Donut.c is tired of the Wii, but don't worry guys, IT'S BACK ON THE 3DS!

### Features:
  - open source AND unlicensed
  - funky music (directly copied from the original Wii port)
  - splash screen (adapted from the original Wii port)
  - ability to fast forward, stop, and rewind (doesn't effect the music for listener)
  - a headerfile with constants you can fine-tune as you please
  - both CIAs and 3DSXs availible as install options
  - donut

### Other notes

All credit goes to Andy Sloane for the original donut.c
And furthermore Jogeir Liljedahl's Addiction for the ambient theme.

Inspired by the original [Wii Donut](https://github.com/GabubuAvailable/Wii-Donut), but only the splash screen was actually used from the code.

I do not have direct permission from the app developer, but I believe releasing the source to the open without a license means that it can be used by anyone under any circumstance.
